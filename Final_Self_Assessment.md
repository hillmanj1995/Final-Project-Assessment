# Final Project Assessment

## Project and Team Summary
Our team, Three Meals, set out to see if there were correlations between the prices of everyday food items (beef, wheat, and milk), and the Dow Jones Index.  Our intention was to then use the data that we found to create a model that would predict whether there would be a rise or fall in the DJIA price for the coming month. 

There were a lot of strengths to the team.  In particular, we were quite supportive of each other’s ideas, yet were able to provide constructive feedback that moved the project forward.  At times we had to make tough decisions on whether an idea provided enough connection/relevance to the analysis, and if it should be something we pursued.  Luckily, all team members were open to feedback and put the betterment of the project above their own personal ideas.  The team was efficient in divvying out work in a manner that didn’t overload a specific team member.  With that said, it may've been beneficial to have all team members have more exposure to the others work.  At times it felt like each role was so regimented, that if a team member for some reason could not work on their item that week, another team member would have a tough time filling in efficiently.

Our machine learning model used logistic regression to predict whether there would be a rise or fall in the DJIA price for the coming month.  While multiple attempts at optimization were made by adding additional data, changing the number of iterations, etc..., the model only had an accuracy score of 66%.  While 66% percent isn't necessarily bad when predicting DJIA price rise/fall, there is room for improvement.

## Self-Assessment
I feel like I had a variety of roles over the course of the final project ranging from data analyst, note-taker, and project manager.  I usually found myself running our team meetings and checking what work got done that week, what was left to do, outlining work for the upcoming week, and providing/receiving feedback.  I also played a role in the data collection and ETL of our food and CPI data.  I helped devise a standardization strategy to clean the data and a log of the data collected and how it applied to the analysis.  

I found that the largest challenge I faced was managing my workflow and making sure that the team and I didn’t stray too far off track or take on too many tasks for the time frame allotted.  There were multiple instances where myself and/or members of the team had great ideas that could absolutely provide an interesting spin on our analysis, however, it would either require too much time to conduct a thorough enough evaluation to include in our presentation, or strayed far enough away from our original questions that it had the potential to be a whole other project in itself.  Choosing what ideas to include was a lesson in work management and team dynamics.

One of our team's strengths was being able to provide feedback on each other’s deliverables.  It was a contribution to the roles were not in my/a respective team member's ballcourt.  I felt that the feedback that was given/received help make a more robust analysis.  I would also fill in for team members tasks that they could not get to that week.
